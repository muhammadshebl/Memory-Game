# Memory Game Project

This is a project to apply JavaScript learned in Front-End Nanodegree course.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## How to play

At the start of the game you will be presented with a deck containing sixteen cards, face down. Click on a card to turn it over to reveal the symbol on the card. If after selecting two cards, given that they are a match, the cards will remain face up and change colour to green. If they do not match they will return to a face down position. The tip for the game is to remember the position of the cards to aid in matching later cards with them.

## Scoring

The move counter will increment by one after each pair of cards is clicked. The star rating system will decrement from three stars after 16, and from two stars after 20 moves. The number of moves (pairs of cards turned over) is displayed at the top of the deck.

Elapsed time is displayed above the deck. This will commence after the first card is clicked.

The game is won by matching all cards in the deck.


## Starting a new game
This can be initiated by clicking Restart button in the game won message pop-up or alternatively by clicking on the restart button  above the deck.
